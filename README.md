# Technical Detail
I made this project with `Asp.net 6` and `Blazor webassembly` also use `maui` with `SQL Server` as database.

In the fact i try to follow `clean architecture` patterns. but this project was built in a hurry. I would really like to refactor this and do full unit testing and integration testing to make this repository as best.
